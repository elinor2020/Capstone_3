Stock Market Data Analysis:
I wish to predict stock market behavior by modeling the VWAP: Volume Weighted Average Price, the target variable to predict. VWAP is a trading benchmark used by traders that gives the average price the stock has traded at throughout the day, based on both volume and price. Deep learning and time series analysis will be used to study the data.
